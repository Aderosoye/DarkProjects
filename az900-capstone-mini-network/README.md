# üåê AZ-900 Capstone Project ‚Äî Azure Mini Enterprise Network

This project simulates a small enterprise network using core Azure services. It was built as the capstone for completing the **Microsoft AZ-900 Learning Path**.

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Design and deploy a virtual network with subnets
- Deploy Windows and Linux VMs with proper segmentation
- Apply NSG rules to isolate traffic
- Create a Storage Account for blob + file data
- Apply governance tools: locks, tags, and policies

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

```
Resource Group: DarkCap
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VNet: DarkVNet (10.0.0.0/16)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subnet-Web (10.0.1.0/24) ‚Üí VM-Web (Windows)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Subnet-App (10.0.2.0/24) ‚Üí VM-App (Linux)

## üß† Learnings & Highlights

- Built and secured a basic cloud network using IaaS
- Applied governance controls like locks, tags, and policies
- Configured NSGs to simulate real-world segmentation
- Reinforced all theoretical concepts from AZ-900 with real deployment

---

## üìà Next Steps

- Expand to include load balancers, VPN gateway, and diagnostics
- Use this project as a template for client deployments or Fiverr offerings
- Upgrade to AZ-104 and implement RBAC, managed identities, etc.
